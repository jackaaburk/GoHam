 elevate the flavor of various recipes, while its natural juiciness ensures
  a succulent dining experience. Whether enjoyed as a centerpiece for holiday feasts or

"Go ham" is an informal slang phrase that encourages someone to put in their maximum effort or energy into a 
particular task or activity. It's an abbreviation for "going hard as a mothaflippa" and is often used to motivate 
or challenge someone to give their all, push their limits, and show relentless determination. Whether in sports, work, 
or any endeavor, going ham signifies an unwavering commitment to achieving one's goals, often with a sense of intensity 
and passion that leaves nothing in reserve.

<h2 style =  "writing-mode: vertical-rl;">How to Cook HAM</h2>
To cook ham, start by preheating your oven to the recommended temperature, 
usually around 325째F (163째C). Place the ham in a roasting pan, cover it with foil to 
retain moisture, and cook for about 15-20 minutes per pound, or until it reaches an internal 
temperature of 145째F (63째C). Basting with glaze or juices periodically can enhance flavor, and 
letting it rest for a few minutes before slicing ensures a juicy and flavorful result.
